= wasmtime example

This is an example of how to build and then run WASM code inside a host
application using libwasmtime.

link:host.c[host.c] is a simple host program that creates a WASM runtime,
loads a WASM example from the `examples` directory.

link:examples[examples] contains examples of programs that can be compiled
to WASM modules.
This includes link:examples/add.c[add.c], a module that contains a function for
adding integers together, and link:examples/translate.c[translate.c], a module
with a `translate` function that inspects and mutates a data buffer within a
WASM linear memory.

To build, set your version of Clang as `WASM_CC` in the
link:Makefile[Makefile] and then run `make`.
