= wasmtime example

This is an example of how to build and then run WASM code inside a host
application using libwasmtime.

link:host.c[host.c] is a simple host program that creates a WASM runtime,
loads a WASM file specified at the command line and runs a function in it.
Currently it only works with a function called "add".

link:examples[examples] contains examples of programs that can be compiled
to WASM modules.
This currently only includes link:examples/add.c[add.c], a module that contains
a function for adding integers together.
